            <h3>Introduction to Basic CSS</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write
                in HTML.</p>

            <p>
                Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization. CSS has been adopted by all
                major browsers and allows you to control:
                <ul>
                    <li>color</li>
                    <li>fonts</li>
                    <li>positioning</li>
                    <li>spacing</li>
                    <li>sizing</li>
                    <li>decorations</li>
                    <li>transitions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements
                with the <code>style</code> attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within <code>style</code>
                tags in an HTML document.
                Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML
                document. Even
                though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because
                they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of
                your code. The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM
                (Document
                Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed
                on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your CatPhotoApp can change it
                from
                simple text to something more.

            <h3>Change the Color of Text</h3>
            <p>Now let's change the color of some of our text.</p>

            <p>We can do this by changing the <code>style</code> of your <code>h2</code> element.</p>

            <p>The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the <code>color</code> style
                property.</p>

            <p>
                Here's how you would set your <code>h2</code> element's text color to blue:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;h2 style=<q>color: blue;</q>&gt;CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2&gt;
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>Note that it is a good practice to end inline <code>style</code> declarations with a <code>;</code> .</p>
        </section>
        <section class="sublesson" id="UseaCSSSelectorstoStyleElements">
            <h3>Use a CSS Selectors to Style Elements</h3>
            <p>
                With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS <code>properties</code> that you can use to change the way an
                element looks on
                your page.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you entered <code>&lt;h2 style=<q>color: red</q>&gt;CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2&gt;</code>, you were
                styling that individual <code>h2</code> element with <code>inline CSS</code>, which stands for <code>Cascading
                    Style Sheets</code>.
            </p>

            <p>That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply <code>CSS</code>.</p>

            <p>
                At the top of your code, create a <code>style</code> block like this:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside that style block, you can create a <code>CSS selector</code> for all <code>h2</code> elements.
                For example, if you wanted
                all <code>h2</code> elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;h2 {color: red;}<br>
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>)
                around each element's
                style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening
                and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style
                rules.

            <h3>Use a CSS Class to Style an Element</h3>
            <p>Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.</p>
            <p>
                Here's an example CSS class declaration:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;.blue-text {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: blue;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;}<br>
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see that we've created a CSS class called <code>blue-text</code> within the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
                tag.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;h2 class="blue-text"&gt;CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that in your CSS <code>style</code> element, class names start with a period. In your HTML
                elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

                Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:<br>
                <code>
                    h1 {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;font-size: 30px;<br>

                You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.

                For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you would use the following
                CSS:<br>
                <code>
                    h2 {<br>

        <section class="sublesson" id="ImportaGoogleFont">
            <h3>Import a Google Font</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, we can also specify
                non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. There are various sources for web fonts on the
                internet but, for this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.
            </p>

            <p>Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.</p>

            <p>
                So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country,
                you will need to skip this challenge).
            </p>

            <p>
                To import a Google Font, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it
                in
                your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the <code>Lobster</code> font. To do this, copy the
                following code
                snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor(before the opening <code>style</code> element):<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;link href=<q>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster</q> rel=<q>stylesheet</q> type=<q>text/css</q>&gt;
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                Now you can use the <code>Lobster</code> font in your CSS by using <code>Lobster</code> as the
                FAMILY_NAME as in the following
                example:<br>
                <code>font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.
                This is covered in the next challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For
                example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.
            </p>

        <section class="sublesson" id="SpecifyHowFontsShouldDegrade">
            <h3>Specify How Fonts Should Degrade</h3>
            <p>
                There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include
                <code>monospace</code>, <code>serif</code> and <code>sans-serif</code>.
            </p>

            <p>When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.</p>

            <p>
                For example, if you wanted an element to use the <code>Helvetica</code> font, but degrade to the <code>sans-serif</code>
                font when
                <code>Helvetica</code> wasn't available, you will specify it as follows:<br>
                <code>
                    p {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS
                keywords.

        <section class="sublesson" id="SizeYourImages">
            <h3>Size Your Images</h3>
            <p>
                CSS has a property called width that controls an element's <code>width</code>. Just like with fonts,
                we'll use <code>px</code> (pixels) to specify the image's width.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called <code>larger-image</code> that gave HTML
                elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:<br>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;.larger-image {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;width: 500px;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;}<br>

            <p>
                There are several benefits to using <code>id</code> attributes: You can use an <code>id</code> to style
                a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements
                with JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>id</code> attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed
                upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same <code>id</code> attribute.
            </p>

                    &lt;h2 id=<q>cat-photo-app</q>&gt;

        <section class="sublesson" id="UseanidAttributetoStyleanElement">
            <h3>Use an id Attribute to Style an Element</h3>
            <p> One cool thing about <code>id</code> attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.</p>

            <p>However, an <code>id</code> is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An <code>id</code>
                also has a higher
                specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting
                styles, the styles of the <code>id</code> will be applied.</p>

            <p>Here's an example of how you can take your element with the <code>id</code> attribute of <code>cat-photo-element</code>
                and give
                it the background color of green. In your <code>style</code> element:<br>
                <code>
                    #cat-photo-element {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;background-color: green;<br>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that inside your <code>style</code> element, you always reference classes by putting a <code>.</code>
                in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a <code>#</code> in front of their names.

            <h3>Adjust the Padding of an Element</h3>
            <p>Now let's put our Cat Photo App away for a little while and learn more about styling HTML.</p>

            <p>You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.</p>

            <p>Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: <code>padding</code>,
                <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code>.</p>

            <p>An element's <code>padding</code> controls the amount of space between the element's content and its
                <code>border</code>.</p>

            <p>Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red

            <h3>Understand Absolute versus Relative Units</h3>
            <p>The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with pixels (<code>px</code>). Pixels
                are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to
                px, CSS has a number of different length unit options that you can use.
            </p>

            <p>The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of
                length. For example, <code>in</code> and <code>mm</code> refer to inches and millimeters, respectively.
                Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences
                depending on a screen's resolution.
            </p>

            <p>Relative units, such as <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>, are relative to another length value. For
                example, <code>em</code> is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the <code>font-size</code>
                property itself, it's relative to the parent's <code>font-size</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Note</strong><br>
                There are several relative unit options that are tied to the size of the viewport. They are covered in
                the Responsive Web Design Principles section.

        <section class="sublesson" id="UseHexCodeforSpecificColors">
            <h3>Use Hex Code for Specific Colors</h3>
            <p>
                Did you know there are other ways to represent colors in CSS? One of these ways is called hexadecimal
                code, or <code>hex code</code> for short.
            </p>

            <p>
                We usually use <code>decimals</code>, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit.
                <code>Hexadecimals</code> (or <code>hex</code>) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen
                distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F
                represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us
                16 total possible values. You can find more information about <code>hexadecimal</code> numbers here.
            </p>

            <p>
                In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and
                blue (B) components. For example, <code>#000000</code> is black and is also the lowest possible value.
                You can find more information about the RGB color system here.<br>
                <code>
                    body {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;color: #000000;<br>
                    }

        <section class="sublesson" id="UseHexCodetoMixColors">
            <h3>Use Hex Code to Mix Colors</h3>
            <p>
                To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and
                blue (B) components.
            </p>

            <p>
                From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16
                million other colors!
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to
                being <code>#FFA500</code>.
            </p>

            <p>The digit <code>0</code> is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.</p>

            <p>
                The digit <code>F</code> is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible
                brightness.

        <section class="sublesson" id="UseAbbreviatedHexCode">
            <h3>Use Abbreviated Hex Code</h3>
            <p>Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to
                remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.</p>

            <p>For example, red's hex code <code>#FF0000</code> can be shortened to <code>#F00</code>. This shortened
                form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.</p>

            <p>This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret <code>#FF0000</code>
                and <code>#F00</code> as exactly the same color.</p>

        <section class="sublesson" id="UseRGBvaluestoColorElements">
            <h3>Use RGB values to Color Elements</h3>
            <p>Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using <code>RGB</code> values.</p>

            <p>
                The RGB value for black looks like this:<br>
                <code>
                    rgb(0, 0, 0)
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                The RGB value for white looks like this:<br>
                <code>
                    rgb(255, 255, 255)
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with <code>RGB</code> you specify the
                brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.</p>

            <p>If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So
                <code>RGB</code>, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex
                code.</p>

            <p>Here's an example of how you'd change the body background to orange using its RGB code.<br>
                <code>
                    body {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0);<br>

                whole page.</p>

            <p>You can then over-write these variables by setting them again within a specific element.</p>

            <h3>Use a media query to change a variable</h3>
            <p>CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.</p>

            <p>For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change
                the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.</p>
