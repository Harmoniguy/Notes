            <h3>Bartok: A Game Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Bartok is a simple game played with a single deck of cards that is very similar to <i>Uno</i>.
                The objective is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. The basic rules are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with a regular deck of playing cards. Remove the Jokers (52 cards).</li>
                    <li>Shuffle the deck and deal seven cards to each player.</li>
                    <li>Place the rest of the cards face-down in a draw pile.</li>
                    <li>Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise, each player must
                        play a card onto the discard pile if possible, and if she cannot play a card, the player must
                        draw a single card from the draw pile</li>
                    <li>A player may play a card onto the discard pile if the card is either:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The same suit as the top card of the discard pile.</li>
                            <li>The same rank as the top card of the discard pile.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The first player to successfully get rid of all of her cards wins.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Playtesting and analysis</h3>
            <p>
                When designing a game, you should try to play the game a couple of times to get a feel for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                After each playtest, it is important to ask the right questions. Each game will require slightly
                different questions, but you can base many of them on these general guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the game of the appropriate difficulty for the intended audience? Is it too difficult, too
                        easy, or just right?</li>
                    <li>Is the outcome of the game based more on strategy or chance? Does randomness play too strong a
                        role in the game, or, alternatively, is the game too deterministic so that after oneplayer has
                        taken the lead, the other players are unable to catch up?</li>
                    <li>Does the game have meaningful, interesting decisions? When it's your turn, do you have
                        several choices, and is the decision between those choices an interesting one?</li>
                    <li>Is the game interesting when it's not your turn? Do you have any effect on the other
                        players' turns, or do their turns have any immediate effect on you?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Modifying the Rules</h3>
            <p>
                Game design is primarily a process:
                <ol>
                    <li>Incrementally modify the rules, changing very few things between each playtest.</li>
                    <li>Playtest the game with the new rules.</li>
                    <li>Analyze how the feel of the game is altered by the new rules</li>
                    <li>Design new rules that you think may move the feel of the game in the direction you want.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process until you're happy with the game.</li>
                </ol>
                <i>Iterative design</i> is the term for this repetitive process of deciding on a small change to the
                game design, implementing that change, playtesting the game, analyzing how the change affected the
                gameplay, and then starting the process over again by deciding on another small change.
